NAME
----
jurand - Java removal of annotations.

SYNOPSIS
--------
*jurand* [*-n*=_<name>_] [*-p*=_<pattern>_] [*-a*] [*-i*] [*-s*] [_<paths>_...]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
A tool for manipulating symbols present in `.java` source files.

The tool can be used for patching `.java` sources in cases where using
sed is insufficient due to Java language syntax. The tool follows Java
language rules rather than applying simple regular expressions on the
source code.

Currently the tool is able to remove `import` statements and
annotations.

OPTIONS
-------
*-n*, *--name*=_<name>_::
  Simple (not fully-qualified) class name.

*-p*, *--pattern*=_<pattern>_::
  Regex pattern to match names used in code.

*-a*::
  Also remove annotations used in code.

*-i*, *--in-place*::
  Replace the contents of files.

*-s*, *--strict*::
  Fail if any of the specified options was redundant and no changes
  associated with the option were made. This option is only applicable
  together with *-i*.
